								<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
								<hr class="mt--10">
								<p>InventoryCount is a first self-hosted Inventory Count Management System that is a great fit for almost any company, merchant, store, supermarket, hypermarket or many other uses. With its clean and modern design, InventoryCount will allow you to have an easy and reliable counting of your products.</p>

								<p>Managing count of yours products is important and IventoryCount helps in several ways:</p>

								<ul>
								   <li>Facilitate the counting of your products with a mobile interface with integrated barcode reader for your counters. 
								   </li>

								</ul>

								<p>InventoryCount does not replace your inventory management system but complements it by giving you a simple interface to manage the counting of your products. And especially thanks to the CSV inventory import available within the application, you can import your inventory data into your usual inventory management application.</p>

								<p>Moreover InventoryCount is easy to install and to use with an A to Z documentation integrated in your backoffice to allow you to make the most of all its features.</p>

								<p>InventoryCount is one of the first applications on the market that focuses only on easy counting of products and it is designed to fulfill this role very well.</p>

									<li>See all users registered in the application and the link to see them all.</li>
								</ul>

								<br>

								<h3>PRODUCTS</h3>
								<hr class="mt--10">
								<p>To allow you to customize the management of your products, only the 3 fields "code, ref and name" are mandatory. The other fields are optional and you can deselect them in : <i>Settings > Product setting</i>.</p>
								<p>3 other product fields such as categories, brands and warehouses have their own management menus in the "Settings" tab.</p>
								<p>So to better manage your products you must first choose the characteristic fields of your products in the menu : <i>Settings > Product setting</i>. These fields are visible by the counter and the validator during their work and can be used to differentiate one product from another in case of doubt, in particular the selling price or the category.</p>
								<p>Finally you can import your products in bulk in : <i>Products > Import products</i>. For this you just have to download the template file to see how your CSV file must be structured to allow the import of your products.</p>


								<br>

								<h3>INVENTORY</h3>
								<hr class="mt--10">
								<p>The essential part of the application is designed according to a simple counting strategy.</p>
								<p>In fact for the counting of your inventory we recommend to split your inventory into several sub-inventories.</p>
								<blockquote>
								  <p>Isn't it said that divide and conquer.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>In fact physically, an under-inventory can be an area of your store, or a landing, or a shelf, or an aisle in your store.</p>

								<p>So the first thing to do is to create sub-inventories. Then you will be able to create the inventories according to your needs by choosing the sub-inventories concerned by the said inventory.</p>

								<p>After adding an inventory you have to go to the inventory list to assign counters to the inventory.</p>
								<p>After the counting step you can go back to the inventory to assign validators to the inventory.</p>

								<p>At the end of the validation, the inventory is completed. And you can see the inventory report and export it in CSV and PDF.</p>


								<br>

								<h3>USER MANAGEMENT</h3>
								<hr class="mt--10">
								<p>InventoryCount comes by default with 3 user accounts : Manager, Counter, Validator.</p>

								<p>When you create a user account you have to assign it to a group.</p>

								<p>Moreover InventoryCount allows you to create user groups and grant them rights.</p>

								<br>
